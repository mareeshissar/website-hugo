I am a master's student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. My research interests include wireless communication, software engineering and artificial intelligence. I am currently working at WINLAB, a cooperative industry-university research center which provides an open forum for collaboration and discussion on emerging wireless technologies and their applications.
