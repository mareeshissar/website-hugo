- Implemented graph search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A* and Bidirectional BFS) for path planning on a 100 X 100 maze with obstacles
- Analyzed the maze-solvability vs obstacle density for the above mentioned algorithms
- Evaluated the performance of A* algorithm using Euclidean and Manhattan heuristics
- Implemented local search algorithms (hill climbing, simulated annealing and genetic) to discover harder mazes
